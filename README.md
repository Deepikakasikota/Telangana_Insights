### For the Population file:

Total population in 2011	35,193,978	  			
Total population in 2023	38,090,000				
					
Increasing population = 2,896,022 = Total pop in 2023 - total pop in 2019			
					
Growth	0.08228743 = increasing population / total pop in 2019			
					
Yearly Growth Percentage = 0.748067545 = (0.7) percentage =  growth * 100 / years  = here years = 11 = difference between 2011 & 2023
			
Yearly Growth = 246358	  =  2011 population * 0.007			
					
Assume it gowing by 0.7%
					
Now the population of 2019 = 37164841 = total pop in 2011 + (8*yearly growth), here 8 because difference between 2011 and 2019			
Population of 2025 = 38642988 = total pop in 2011 + (14*yearly growth), here 14 because difference between 2011 and 2025
